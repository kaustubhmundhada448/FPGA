Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_XLXN_127/XLXI_20/XLXI_67/Q_DUMMY_BUFG" (output
   signal=XLXN_127) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads
   are:
   Pin D of XLXI_25/XLXI_41/XLXI_39
Running directed packing...
Running delay-based LUT packing...
Running related packing...

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_8/RST is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_6/dec is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Kd<3>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Kp<3>_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%

  Number of RPM macros:           18
Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.30

Peak Memory Usage:  291 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  5 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   4 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
